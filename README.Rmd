# nalar

nalar is my personal R package in which I will place various code for analysis and plotting that I find
useful and plan to use a lot. I'll try to keep it documented, tested and working, so feel free to use.

## Installation

You can install the released version of nalar from [github](https://www.github.com/Alanocallaghan/nalar) with:

``` r
install_github("Alanocallaghan/nalar")
```
